### Description
  
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves.  
To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.  
  
## Mandatory Part
  
```
$ make
$ ./push_swap <numbers in stack>
```
  
## Using checker_(OS)
  
```
$ ARG="<numbers in stack>; ./push_swap $ARG | ./check_(OS) $ARG"
```
  
## BOUNS

```
$ make bonus
$ ./checker <numbers in stack>
instraction
instraction
instraction
...
(ctrl + D)
```
